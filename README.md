# Better-Reading-Notes
Better reading notes! I'm using Obsidian, and the lovely Obsidian for Git!
This is a work in progress, and hopefully not too confusing to follow. 

If you'd like these notes on your computer, download obsidian here:

https://obsidian.md/

And then install the Git for Obsidian plugin and follow the setup guidelines here - fork the repo.

Please leave any feedback if you notice something I'm wrong about. ðŸ¤¥
