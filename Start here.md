#the-beginning

This is the central document. Off this one, you'll see 3 main nodes, and nodes off those ones (and same files share nodes!)

As we all know, the web is built of CSS, HTML, and JS - these are where to start. I have a fourth branch, Comp Sci, that covers, in a more general sense, computer science stuff (duh!). 
This collection is focused on full-stack webdev. 

Another useful thing to look at is files marked under the #what-are tag - this covers some terminology more in-depth than the cheatsheet, and makes comparisons between difference concepts that are easy to get confused with each-other. 

This means that I might have an article on Arrays in Javascript, and another one on Arrays in general. I'm going to try and keep the JS side as a quick (?!?) reference, and the CompSci side as a deeper look at the topic, but there will be of-course lots of overlap.
