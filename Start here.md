#the-beginning

This is the central document. Off this one, you'll see 3 main nodes, and nodes off those ones (and same files share nodes!)

As we all know, the web is built off CSS, HTML, and JS - these are were to start. I have a fourth branch, Comp Sci, that covers, in a more general sense, computer science stuff (duh!). 

This means that I might have an article on Arrays in Javascript, and another one on Arrays in general. I'm going to try and keep the JS side as a quick (?!?) reference, and the CompSci side as a deeper look at the topic, but there will be of-course lots of overlap.
