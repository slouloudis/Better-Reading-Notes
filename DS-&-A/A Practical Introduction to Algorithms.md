Why should we care about algorithms?

Algorithms are - and I'm being redundant - steps we tell the computer to take to solve a problem. Why should we worry? Well, we're engineers, even if you wouldn't call yourself one, and it's our job to solve problems. (even if it is the problem of centring a piece of text.)

For example, this might be Sam's Centring Algorithm -> 

```
1. whack a text align center on it - it doesn't only work on text, afterall
2. try adding margin: 0;
3. mess with the display property in the dev tools
4. switch to flex and use place-content: center;
5. give up and google it (again)
6. last resort: use display relative on parent and absolute on child
```

It's not very efficient right? If I wanted to be more efficient and complete the problem faster, I might be better off just googling it straight away. Or even, god-forbid, actually learn why all the different methods work and on what. 

Now obviously my algorithm isn't something a computer would use, but it's the same idea - we think about an issue, we identify what we want the outcome to be, and we write a series of steps to take to solve a problem. After that, it's probably worth considering if we can improve our algorithm. How much time does it take? How much memory does it take? What are the tradeoffs for better performance? How easily can other people reading your instructions understand them; they may need to be edited, after all. 

It's satisfying to solve problems, right? This section is all about methods to help you understand approaches, identify patterns, and improving the speed of our programs.
