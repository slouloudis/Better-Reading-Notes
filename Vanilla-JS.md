For now, this is going to be a bit sparse of any `console.log('Hello World!')`

I'm planning on building out a more compact quick reference section, but for now I really want to dive deep into topics. 

This wont be covering the history of Javascript, but it is worth knowing. The biggest thing to know is ECMAScript is a scripting language standard, while JavaScript is the implementation of that standard. ECMAScript defines the core features and syntax, while JavaScript extends and applies these features in web browsers and other environments. ECMA International are based in Geneva, Switzerland, and is mainly composed of tech companies.
