#what-are
- 
- Modules are individual tools or pieces of code that perform specific tasks.
- Libraries are collections of related modules that solve specific problems.
- Packages are a way to organise and group related modules and libraries together in a hierarchical manner.
- Frameworks are comprehensive sets of tools, guidelines, and pre-written code that provide a structure and foundation for building applications.

In the context of the MERN stack, you could think of these in the following way - 

- A module can be a JavaScript file that exports functions or variables that you can import into your code. For example, you might have a module that handles user authentication or a module that connects to your MongoDB database.
- In React, you might use a library like React Router to handle client-side routing or a library like Axios to make HTTP requests to your server. These libraries offer ready-to-use functions and components that simplify your development process and allow you to focus on building your application.
- When you set up a new project using the MERN stack, you might use a package like "create-react-app" to quickly generate a React application with all the necessary configuration. This package includes various modules and libraries related to React, allowing you to start building your application without having to set up everything from scratch.
- The main frameworks in the MERN stack are Express.js and React. Express.js is a backend framework that runs on Node.js and provides a structured way to handle server-side operations like routing, handling HTTP requests, and connecting to databases like MongoDB. React, on the other hand, is a frontend framework that allows you to build user interfaces using reusable components and provides efficient ways to manage application state.

Frameworks like Express.js and React provide guidelines and conventions to structure your code and handle common tasks, which can greatly speed up your development process. They offer a higher level of abstraction compared to modules and libraries, allowing you to focus on building your application's specific features rather than dealing with low-level details.
