How have we tricked a rock into thinking and learning?

Lamda calculus - lisp. 
Turing machines - c.

The Structure of Scientific revolutions (1962)

**The Transformation Hierarchy** 
Problem -> Algorithm -> Program/Language -> System Software -> SW/HW Interface -> Micro-architecture -> Logic -> Devices -> Electrons.

**Hamming distance** -> Number of locations in which the corresponding symbols of two equal-length strings is different. 

So if you were comparing the strings `cat` and `dog` their Hamming Distance would be 3. 

Based on this Hamming developed a theory of codes used for error detection and correction.

# How can we optimise the computer for the user?

	Who is the user? The Programmer? The system architect? 

Algorithm designs don't need to know anything about the SW/HW Interface, or the Micro-architecture. Abstractions - The higher level only needs to know about its interface to the lower level, now how the lower level is implement. 

	High-level language programmer does not really need to know what the ISA is and how a computer executes instructions. 

Abstraction improved productivity. Our knowledge base is limited.
